Howdy! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science & Engineering Department at Dalian University of Technology, advised by Prof. Hongfei Lin. I'm broadly interested in the area of data mining, machine learning and recommender systems. Specifically, my research focuses on:

* Fairness
* Recommender Systems

<!--<span style="color:red">What's New</span>-->


<!--* <span style="color:red">New!!</span> Our paper "[Learning interpretable cellular and gene signature embeddings from single-cell transcriptomic data](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.13.426593v1.full)", collaborated with Prof. Yue Li at McGill Univesity, has been accepted to [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/ncomms/). Congrats to the leading author Yifan Zhao and Huiyu Cai.-->
